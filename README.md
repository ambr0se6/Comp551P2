To run Naive Bayes Classifier, run runNB.py. This will also print out the accuracy of each fold in the cross-validation, as well as the mean accuracy.
comparePredictions.py can be run to view a breakdown of test set prediction files for the Naive Bayes classifier, using different methods of feature extraction.
To run the bagging classifiers, use the run_ensemble.py.
